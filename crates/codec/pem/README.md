# reallyme-codec-pem

`reallyme-codec-pem` parses and emits PEM text armor: BEGIN/END labels,
base64 bodies, line ending normalization, strict label matching, and size
limits.

It deliberately does not interpret DER, ASN.1, or cryptographic key structure.
Use this crate when you need the text envelope only. Algorithm-aware key import
belongs in `reallyme-crypto`.
