# reallyme-codec-proto

`reallyme-codec-proto` contains the Rust Buffa bindings for
`reallyme.codec.v1`. The package is intentionally small: it publishes the
codec error envelope used by services and SDK boundaries without pulling in the
crypto protobuf package.

```toml
[dependencies]
reallyme-codec-proto = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["generated"] }
```

The protobuf source lives at
[`proto/reallyme/codec/v1/codec.proto`](../../../proto/reallyme/codec/v1/codec.proto).
Runtime codec operations still use the typed errors from `reallyme-codec`; this
crate is for wire/config contracts and generated protobuf integration.
